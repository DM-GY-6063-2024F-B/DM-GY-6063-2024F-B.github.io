    ### Intro:

    This assignment is an opportunity to explore how to repeat simple commands so many times that the resulting visuals seem random and chaotic. Sometimes the result of a loop is something repetitive, while other times the actions are repetitive, but the result is unpredictable.

    ---
    ### Getting Started and Submitting:

    For all of the exercises we'll start by cloning [our template](https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-2024F-B/p5js-template) and setting up our GitHub app to pull (download) our repo and then push (upload) the results.

    You'll be turning in 2 links for your sketches, so name your repositories HW04A and HW04B.

    Since the computer is gonna be doing all the work of filling our screen, please use: `createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)`.

    Like last assignment, please [enable GitHub pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqjPr7auwdY) on your GitHub repos and use [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407563) to submit GitHub links to all 2 of your repositories.

    ## Evaluation
    This assignment will be graded on a scale from 1 to 10, taking the following criteria into account:

    - README: repository includes a `README.md` file with information about the design process.
    - Compliance: work follows the requirements specified in the assignment description.
    - Implementation: work shows evidence of understanding programming concepts and you are fully using them to express your ideas.
    - Thoughtfulness: project demonstrates your personality and it’s not a straightforward re-implementation of someone else’s idea.
    - Craft: code and results show care and consideration for presentation and professionalism, and work doesn’t look like it was rushed.

    ### HW03B

    Sol LeWitt [Drawing Instruction](https://whitney.org/education/families/kids-art-challenge/sol-lewitt) (5 points)

    Read about Sol LeWitt, his work and his Wall Drawing series [HERE](https://publicdelivery.org/sol-lewitt-wall-drawings/).

    Pick one of the Wall Drawings from [THIS FILE](/assets/homework/04/wall-drawings.json) (or elsewhere) and recreate it with p5.js using `for()` loops and `random()`.

    Use variables for all of the parameters in the instruction, so you can easily extend and modify the drawing by adjusting the code. For example, define the number of points or lines in the instruction as a variable, and experiment by changing its value to 90, 100, 1000, etc.

    ### Tips and Hints:

    For all of these, it helps to draw out your strategy before sitting down to write any code. Can you break the problem up into smaller problems? Is there a logical order for the steps that have to be carried out by the computer? Can the visuals be drawn using smaller and simpler routines or do they have to be drawn at once?

    HW03A:  
    Add little bits of variation and randomness one step at a time until the shapes look irregular. This is better than starting with every variable being random and then not knowing which parameters are responsible for each shape.

    HW03B:  
    Most of the Wall Drawing instructions are a little bit vague, but that's part of the beauty of these pieces by [Sol LeWitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt). For instructions that require connecting points, it's never clear if each point has to be connected to every other point, or if each point is just connected to one other point, or something else in between. Also... "non-straight line" is open to interpretation. Is it a curve? a wavy line? an arc? All of these?

    Remember that if you need to re-use a `random()` value in multiple places (to draw points and lines at the same random locations, for example), you have to assign it to a variable.

  intro: |
    Keep these questions in mind while you read this week's text, do a bit of research and write your 200-word response:
  description: |
    Instructions here .... X!X!X!X!X!

    As always, your response should be personal, meaning that you should be expressing your views and opinions about the text and not just summarizing it. You can use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: in one or two phrases, what is the text about?
    - Did you learn something new? What?
    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?

    Please submit your response via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407563).

    Grading for the reading response will be assigned following these considerations:

    | Response | Grade|
    | --- | --- |
    | Only described the work | 2 points |
    | Answered some of the prompts, but I can't tell whether<br>you actually read about the work or what you thought | 3 points |
    | Answered enough prompts to express opinions | 5 points |
