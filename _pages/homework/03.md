    ### Intro:

    This assignment will give us practice with loops and other commands that we use to get the computer to do repetitive tasks. The concept of loops is not that difficult to understand at a high level: "*repeat this code X times*", but in practice we always have to think about small "gotchas" and [corner cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_case). As we implement these sketches we will see how loops and repetitions can be used to create "ordered" structures and patterns, but we'll also see how to repeat simple commands so many times that the resulting images seem random and chaotic. Sometimes the result of a loop is something repetitive, while other times the actions are repetitive, but the result is unpredictable.

    [This article](https://www.widewalls.ch/magazine/repetition-in-art-artists-photography) has interesting references of artists that used repetition in their process, and anyone who has ever done any kind of [graphic design](https://www.graphicszoo.com/article/basic-principles-of-repetition-in-graphic-design-design-guide) knows how important it is to master "The Grid" and color palettes.

    ### Getting Started and Submitting:

    For all of the exercises we'll start by cloning [our template](https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-2024F-B/p5js-template) and setting up our GitHub app to pull (download) our repo and then push (upload) the results.

    You'll be turning in 2 links for your sketches, so name your repositories HW03A and HW03B.

    We are not interested in replicating exact shapes and aspect ratios, and since the computer is gonna be doing all the work of filling our canvas we can define that with: ```createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);``` and use the whole screen.

    Like last assignment, please [enable GitHub pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqjPr7auwdY) on your GitHub repos and use [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407563) to submit GitHub links to all 3 of your repositories.

    ### From Order To Chaos:

    HW03A. The fake [Yayoi Kusama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yayoi_Kusama) (5 points):  
    Using nested ```for()``` loops, replicate the following pattern.  
    Since this is a very regular pattern you should be able to get something pretty close.

    <div class="image-row image-row-kusama-1" markdown=1>
      <div class="img-wrapper" markdown=1>
      ![](/assets/homework/03/kusama-00.jpg)
      </div>
    </div>

    Once you have the regular patter, start experimenting with the `random()` function to add variability, unpredictability and irregularity to the pattern.

    If you look at other works by [Yayoi Kusama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yayoi_Kusama), you'll notice that most of her works use multiple sizes of ellipses, the shapes usually don't overlap, and it's initially difficult to see any kind of pattern, like these:

    <div class="image-row image-row-2 image-row-kusama-2" markdown=1>
      <div class="img-wrapper" markdown=1>
      ![](/assets/homework/03/kusama-01.jpg)
      </div>
      <div class="img-wrapper" markdown=1>
      ![](/assets/homework/03/kusama-02.jpg)
      </div>
    </div>

    You don't have to replicate any artwork here. Play with randomness, with loops and shape parameters to create a variation that is your own.

    HW03B. Sol LeWitt [Drawing Instruction](https://whitney.org/education/families/kids-art-challenge/sol-lewitt) (5 points):  

    Read about Sol LeWitt, his work and his Wall Drawing series [HERE](https://publicdelivery.org/sol-lewitt-wall-drawings/).

    Pick one of the Wall Drawings from [THIS FILE](/assets/homework/03/wall-drawings.json) (or elsewhere) and recreate it with p5.js using `for()` loops and `random()`.

    Use variables for all of the parameters in the instruction, so you can easily extend and modify the drawing by adjusting the code. For example, define the number of points or lines in the instruction as a variable, and experiment by changing its value to 90, 100, 1000, etc.

    ### Tips and Hints:

    For all of these, it helps to draw out your strategy before sitting down to write any code. Can you break the problem up into smaller problems? Is there a logical order for the steps that have to be carried out by the computer? Can the visuals be drawn using smaller and simpler routines or do they have to be drawn at once?

    HW03A:  
    This pattern could be done with one set of nested `for()` loops and some tricky math using division remainders, but the more straightforward way is to break up the pattern into multiple overlapping sub-patterns, each with its own set of nested `for()` loops.

    For the smaller ellipses: since they are of the same color, some of them can actually be drawn on top of or behind the larger ones.

    For the larger ones: if taken as one pattern, the larger ellipses follow a checkerboard logic, where every other row (and column) is the same. But, you can think about splitting them up into two patterns, where the pattern made by the even rows is just like the one made by the odd rows, but shifted ([`translated()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/translate)) down and to the right.

    Doing it like this ends up taking 3 sets of nested for loops.

    For variation and randomness, add little bits of variation one step at a time until the shapes look irregular. This is better than starting with every variable being random and then not knowing which parameters are responsible for each shape.

    HW03B:  
    Most of the Wall Drawing instructions are a little bit vague, but that's part of the beauty of these pieces by [Sol LeWitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt). For instructions that require connecting points, it's never clear if each point has to be connected to every other point, or if each point is just connected to one other point, or something else in between. Also... "non-straight line" is open to interpretation. Is it a curve? a wavy line? an arc? All of these?

    Remember that if you need to re-use a `random()` value in multiple places (to draw points and lines at the same random locations, for example), you have to assign it to a variable.

  title: Is there just one technology? Is there just one way to learn, create or engage with technology?
  intro: |
    Keep these questions in mind while you read this week's text, do a bit of research and write your 200-word response:
  description: |
    While relevant to discussions regarding media literacy and reasons to learn programming, our first reading presented a very particular point of view, modulated by the author's gender, social position and geographical location. It did recognize that the world of technology and programming is more plural and "messy" than most people acknowledge, but it didn't explicitly address any issues of social, racial or historical inequalities. So, this week we will take a look at the "messy" worlds of cyberfeminism to get an introduction to other ways of "reading" technology.

    There is a short reading that is a bit more optimistic while giving reasons for being more active in how we think about technology, and then we'll do a bit of research on the [Cyberfeminism Index](https://cyberfeminismindex.com/). Start by reading [about](https://cyberfeminismindex.com/about/) the project, and then, scroll through the index on the main page, select 5 - 10 entries that you find interesting, and create your personal Cyberfeminism collection. As you click on entries on the home page, a column will pop up on the right side of the screen with your selections. After you've selected 5 - 10 entries you can click on the download button to generate a pdf with your choices.

    Cyberfeminism is not just about women or feminism. It's about ways of understanding technology from different perspectives.

    As always, your response should be personal, meaning that you should be expressing your views and opinions about the text and not just summarizing it. You can use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: in one or two phrases, what is the Glitch Feminism text about?
    - Did you learn something new? What?
    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?
    - Why did you select those entries from the Cyberfeminism Index? It can be a simple reason like: "I'm interested in the latin american perspective on technology", or "I want to learn more about the history of science", or "I'm interested in gender and social equality in technology and society".

    Please submit your response via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407563), and attach your Cyberfeminism Index collection pdf.

    Grading for the readings will be assigned following these considerations:

    | Response | Grade|
    | --- | --- |
    | Only summarized the reading | 1 point |
    | Answered some of the prompts, but I can't tell whether<br>you actually read the text, or what you thought | 2 points |
    | Answered enough prompts to express opinions | 3 points |
    | Answered enough prompts to express opinions<br>and included the pdf | 5 points |
